NZ_DS995511	GenBank	region	1	11090	.	+	1	ID=NZ_DS995511;Dbxref=BioProject:PRJNA224116,taxon:483216;Name=NZ_DS995511;Note=Bacteroides eggerthii DSM 20697 Scfld3%2C whole genome shotgun sequence.,REFSEQ INFORMATION: The reference sequence was derived from DS995511. Bacteroides eggerthii (GenBank Accession Number for 16S rDNA gene: L16485) is a member of the Bacteroidetes division of the domain bacteria and has been isolated from human feces. The sequenced strain was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH (DSMZ) (DSM 20697). This is a Newbler assembly (http://www.454.com/enabling-technology/the-software.asp) consisting of 2 full plate runs of a fragment library and 2 full plate runs of a paired end library with a Q20 coverage of 60.8X. This sequenced strain is part of a comprehensive,sequence-based survey of members of the normal human gut microbiota. A joint effort of the WU-GSC and the Center for Genome Sciences at Washington University School of Medicine,the purpose of this survey is to provide the general scientific community with a broad view of the gene content of 100 representatives of the major divisions represented in the intestine's microbial community. This information should provide a frame of reference for analyzing metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome. Further details of this effort are described in a white paper entitled 'Extending Our View of Self: the Human Gut Microbiome Initiative (HGMI)' (http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/HGMIS eq.pdf). These studies are supported by National Human Genome Research Institute.

These studies are supported by National Human Genome Research Institute. Coding sequences were predicted using GeneMark v3.3 and Glimmer2 v2.13. Intergenic regions not spanned by GeneMark and Glimmer2 were blasted against NCBI's non-redundant (NR) database and predictions generated based on protein alignments. tRNA genes were determined using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 and non-coding RNA genes by RNAmmer-1.2 and Rfam v8.0. Gene names are generated at the contig level and may not necessarily reflect any known order or orientation between contigs.

Annotation was added to the contigs in December 2008. This is a reference genome for the Human Microbiome Project. This project is co-owned with the Human Microbiome Project DACC. The annotation was added by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP).
