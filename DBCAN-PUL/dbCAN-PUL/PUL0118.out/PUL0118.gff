NZ_DS362241	GenBank	region	1	14533	.	+	1	ID=NZ_DS362241;Dbxref=BioProject:PRJNA224116,ATCC:8492,taxon:411479;Name=NZ_DS362241;Note=Bacteroides uniformis ATCC 8492 Scfld_3.0.1_24%2C whole genome shotgun sequence.,REFSEQ INFORMATION: The reference sequence was derived from DS362241. Bacteroides uniformis (GenBank Accession Number for 16S rDNA gene: L16486) is a member of the division Bacteroidetes. In one comprehensive 16S rDNA sequence-based enumeration of the colonic microbiota of three healthy adult humans,it represents,on average,0.718%25 of all 16S rDNA sequences and 1.506%25 of the sequences in its division (Eckburg et. al. (2005)). The sequenced strain was obtained from ATCC (ATCC 8492). We have collected 8.1X coverage in plasmid end reads and 454 reads. We will be performing one round of automated sequence improvement (pre-finishing),Sequencing/Assembly: The genomic DNA was purified from liquid culture derived from a single bacterial colony. A hybrid sequencing strategy that utilized reads from both 454 GS-20 and ABI 3730xl sequencers was devised and implemented to generate the draft genome sequences. 454 reads were assembled using Newbler (454 Life Sciences) into 454 de novo contigs. These de novo contigs were converted in silico to 800 base paired reads ('superreads') with 400 base overlaps with neighboring superreads. Finally,PCAP (Huang,et al,Genome Research,13:2164,(2003)) was used to assemble the super-reads and the conventional 3730xl capillary reads. This sequenced strain is part of a comprehensive,sequence-based survey of members of the normal human gut microbiota. A joint effort of the WU-GSC and the Center for Genome Sciences at Washington University School of Medicine,the purpose of this survey is to provide the general scientific community with a broad view of the gene content of 100 representatives of the major divisions represented in the intestine's microbial community. This information should provide a frame of reference for analyzing metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome. Further details of this effort are described in a white paper entitled 'Extending Our View of Self: the Human Gut Microbiome Initiative (HGMI)' (http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/HGMIS eq.pdf).
