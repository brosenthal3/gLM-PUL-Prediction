NZ_KB290636	GenBank	region	1	7838	.	+	1	ID=NZ_KB290636;Dbxref=BioProject:PRJNA224116,HMP:0369,taxon:649757;Name=NZ_KB290636;Note=Anaerostipes hadrus DSM 3319 Scfld13%2C whole genome shotgun sequence.,REFSEQ INFORMATION: The reference sequence is identical to KB290636.1.  Anaerostipes hadrus DSM 3319 is a member of the Firmicutes division  of the domain Bacteria and has been isolated from the GI tract.    This is a reference genome for the Human Microbiome Project. This  project is co-owned with the Human Microbiome Project DACC.    The sequenced strain was obtained directly from ATCC (ATCC 29173).  Source DNA was prepared by Michelle Daigneault and Emma  Allen-Vercoe (Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology,University of Guelph,Ontario,Canada),and was funded by the NHGRI  (through an HMP Technology Development Grant - 1R21HG005811 - 01).    Coding sequences were predicted using GeneMark v3.3 and Glimmer3  v3.02. Intergenic regions not spanned by GeneMark and Glimmer3 were  blasted against NCBI's non-redundant (NR) database and predictions  generated based on protein alignments. tRNA genes were determined  using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 and non-coding RNA genes by RNAmmer-1.2 and  Rfam v8.1. The final gene set is processed through several programs  such as Kegg (Release 56),psortB (Version 3.0.3) and Interproscan  (Version 4.7) to determine possible function. Gene product names  are determined by BER (Version 2.5). Gene names are generated at  the contig level and may not necessarily reflect any known order or  orientation between contigs.    The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI),National  Institutes of Health (NIH) is funding the sequence characterization  of the Anaerostipes hadrus DSM 3319 genome.
