NZ_DS995531	GenBank	region	1	15370	.	+	1	ID=NZ_DS995531;Dbxref=BioProject:PRJNA224116,taxon:483217;Name=NZ_DS995531;Note=Phocaeicola dorei DSM 17855 Scfld3%2C whole genome shotgun sequence.,REFSEQ INFORMATION: The reference sequence is identical to DS995531.1.  Bacteroides dorei (GenBank Accession Number for 16S rDNA gene:  AB242142) is a member of the Bacteroidetes division of the domain  bacteria and has been isolated from human feces. The sequenced  strain was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und  Zellkulturen GmbH (DSMZ)(DSM 17855).    This is a Newbler assembly  (http://www.454.com/enabling-technology/the-software.asp)  consisting of one full plate of a Roche 454 FLX fragment library  and one full plate of a Roche 454 FLX paired end library run with a  Q20 coverage of 38.4X.    This sequenced strain is part of a comprehensive,sequence-based  survey of members of the normal human gut microbiota. A joint  effort of the WU-GSC and the Center for Genome Sciences at  Washington University School of Medicine,the purpose of this  survey is to provide the general scientific community with a broad  view of the gene content of 100 representatives of the major  divisions represented in the intestine's microbial community. This  information should provide a frame of reference for analyzing  metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome. Further details of  this effort are described in a white paper entitled 'Extending Our  View of Self: the Human Gut Microbiome Initiative (HGMI)'  (http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/HGMIS  eq.pdf). These studies are supported by National Human Genome  Research Institute.

These studies are supported by National Human Genome  Research Institute.    Coding sequences were predicted using GeneMark v3.3 and Glimmer2  v2.13. Intergenic regions not spanned by GeneMark and Glimmer2 were  blasted against NCBI's non-redundant (NR) database and predictions  generated based on protein alignments. tRNA genes were determined  using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 and non-coding RNA genes by RNAmmer-1.2 and  Rfam v8.0. Gene names are generated at the contig level and may not  necessarily reflect any known order or orientation between contigs.

Annotation was added to the contigs in November 2008.    This is a reference genome for the Human Microbiome Project. This  project is co-owned with the Human Microbiome Project DACC.
