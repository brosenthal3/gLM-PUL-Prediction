NZ_DS990119	GenBank	region	1	28955	.	+	1	ID=NZ_DS990119;Dbxref=BioProject:PRJNA224116,taxon:484018;Name=NZ_DS990119;Note=Phocaeicola plebeius DSM 17135 Scfld_02_2%2C whole genome shotgun sequence.,REFSEQ INFORMATION: The reference sequence is identical to DS990119.1.    On Mar 3,2009 this sequence version replaced NW_002063610.1.  Bacteroides plebeius (GenBank Accession Number for 16S rDNA gene:  AB200217) is a member of the Bacteroidetes division of the domain  bacteria and has been isolated from human feces. The sequenced  strain was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und  Zellkulturen GmbH (DSMZ)(DSM 17135).    We have collected 7.9X coverage in plasmid end reads and 454 reads.  We have performed one round of automated sequence improvement  (pre-finishing),along with manual improvement that includes  breaking apart any mis-assembly,and making manual joins where  possible. Manual edits also are made where the consensus appears to  be incorrect. All low quality data on the ends of contigs is  removed. Contigs are ordered and oriented where possible.    Sequencing/Assembly: The genomic DNA was purified from liquid  culture derived from a single bacterial colony. A hybrid sequencing  strategy that utilized reads from both 454 GS-20 and ABI 3730xl  sequencers was devised and implemented to generate the draft genome  sequences. 454 reads were assembled using Newbler (454 Life  Sciences) into 454 de novo contigs. These de novo contigs were  converted in silico to 800 base paired reads ('superreads') with  400 base overlaps with neighboring superreads. Finally,PCAP  (Huang,et al,Genome Research,13:2164,(2003)) was used to  assemble the super-reads and the conventional 3730xl capillary  reads.    This sequenced strain is part of a comprehensive,sequence-based  survey of members of the normal human gut microbiota. A joint  effort of the WU-GSC and the Center for Genome Sciences at  Washington University School of Medicine,the purpose of this  survey is to provide the general scientific community with a broad  view of the gene content of 100 representatives of the major  divisions represented in the intestine's microbial community. This  information should provide a frame of reference for analyzing  metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome. Further details of  this effort are described in a white paper entitled 'Extending Our  View of Self: the Human Gut Microbiome Initiative (HGMI)'  (http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/HGMIS  eq.pdf).

These studies are supported by National Human Genome  Research Institute.    Coding sequences were predicted using GeneMark v3.3 and Glimmer2  v2.13. Intergenic regions not spanned by GeneMark and Glimmer2 were  blasted against NCBI's non-redundant (NR) database and predictions  generated based on protein alignments. tRNA genes were determined  using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 and non-coding RNA genes by RNAmmer-1.2 and  Rfam v8.0. Gene names are generated at the contig level and may not  necessarily reflect any known order or orientation between contigs.
