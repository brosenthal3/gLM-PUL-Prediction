URL -- http://www.jgi.doe.gov  JGI Project ID: 2351473  Source DNA and bacteria available from Mark McBride  Contacts: Mark McBride (mcbride@uwm.edu)  Paul Richardson (microbes@cuba.jgi-psf.org)  Plasmid and fosmid libraries were prepared at the Joint Genome  Institute (JGI) Production Genomics Facility (JGI-PGF) in Walnut  Creek,CA. Shotgun sequencing was performed at the JGI-PGF to a  coverage of 15x. Large (40 kb),medium (8 kb) and small (3 kb)  insert random libraries were partially sequenced with average  success rate of 90%25 and average high-quality read lengths of 634  nucleotides. Finishing was performed at JGI-LANL starting with 29  contigs and 2 scaffolds. Repetitive regions were identified,assembled and finished by manually checking paired reads close to  each repeat in the assembly with consed and then making a  subassembly for each repetitive region. 27 gaps were closed with  primer walks and 2 by PCR. Gene predictions were obtained using  Glimmer and tRNAs were identified using tRNAScan-SE. Basic analysis  of the gene predictions was performed by comparing coding sequences  against the PFam,BLOCKS and Prodom databases. Gene definitions and  functional classes were added manually by a team of annotators at  JGI-LANL,using BLAST results in addition to information from the  basic analysis. A total of 3793 features have been annotated on the  sequence record.  The JGI and collaborators endorse the principles for the  distribution and use of large scale sequencing data adopted by the  larger genome sequencing community and urge users of this data to  follow them. it is our intention to publish the work of this  project in a timely fashion and we welcome collaborative  interaction on the project and analysis.  (http://www.genome.gov/page.cfm?pageID%3D10506376).  The annotation was added by the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation  Pipeline (PGAP).
