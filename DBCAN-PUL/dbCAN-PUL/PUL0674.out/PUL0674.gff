NZ_DS264579	GenBank	region	1	17371	.	+	1	ID=NZ_DS264579;Dbxref=BioProject:PRJNA224116,ATCC:8483,taxon:411476;Name=NZ_DS264579;Note=Bacteroides ovatus ATCC 8483 Scfld0226%2C whole genome shotgun sequence.,REFSEQ INFORMATION: The reference sequence is identical to DS264579.1.  Bacteroides ovatus (GenBank Accession Number for 16S rDNA gene:  X83952) is a member of the division Bacteroidetes. In one  comprehensive 16S rDNA sequence-based enumeration of the colonic  microbiota of three healthy adult humans,it represents,on  average,0.034%25 of all 16S rDNA sequences and 0.071%25 of the  sequences in its division (Eckburg et. al. (2005)). The sequenced  strain was obtained from ATCC (ATCC 8483T).    We have collected 6.9X coverage in plasmid end reads and 454 reads.  We will be performing one round of automated sequence improvement  (pre-finishing).    Sequencing/Assembly: The genomic DNA was purified from liquid  culture derived from a single bacterial colony. A hybrid sequencing  strategy that utilized reads from both 454 GS-20 and ABI 3730xl  sequencers was devised and implemented to generate the draft genome  sequences. 454 reads were assembled using Newbler (454 Life  Sciences) into 454 de novo contigs. These de novo contigs were  converted in silico to 800 base paired reads ('superreads') with  400 base overlaps with neighboring superreads. Finally,PCAP  (Huang,et al,Genome Research,13:2164,(2003)) was used to  assemble the super-reads and the conventional 3730xl capillary  reads.    This sequenced strain is part of a comprehensive,sequence-based  survey of members of the normal human gut microbiota. A joint  effort of the WU-GSC and the Center for Genome Sciences at  Washington University School of Medicine,the purpose of this  survey is to provide the general scientific community with a broad  view of the gene content of 100 representatives of the major  divisions represented in the intestine's microbial community. This  information should provide a frame of reference for analyzing  metagenomic studies of the human gut microbiome. Further details of  this effort are described in a white paper entitled 'Extending Our  View of Self: the Human Gut Microbiome Initiative (HGMI)'  (http://www.genome.gov/Pages/Research/Sequencing/SeqProposals/HGMIS  eq.pdf).

These studies are supported by National Human Genome  Research Institute.    Coding sequences were predicted using GeneMark v3.3 and Glimmer2  v2.13. Intergenic regions notspanned by GeneMark and Glimmer2 were  blasted against NCBI'snon-redundant (NR) database and predictions  generated based on proteinalignments. RNA genes were determined  using tRNAscan-SE 1.23 or Rfamv8.0. Gene names are generated at the  contig level and may notnecessarily reflect any known order or  orientation betweencontigs.
